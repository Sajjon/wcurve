= DESCRIPTION =

This package implements basic arithmetic operations such as point addition and
single-scalar multiplication on elliptic curves in short Weiertsrass form.

Example:
    import wcurve, random
    # Instantiate secp256r1 standardized curve
    curve  = wcurve.secp256r1_curve()
    # Generate a new secret value
    sk = random.SystemRandom().randint(1, curve.n - 1)
    # Compute the public key associated to the previous secret
    pk = sk * curve.base_point
    # Get its affine coordinates
    pkx, pky = pk.to_affine()

See directly wcurve.py for a more detailed description.
